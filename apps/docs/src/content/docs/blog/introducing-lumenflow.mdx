AI agents are writing more code than ever. They push to production, modify infrastructure, and make decisions that affect real systems. But there's a fundamental problem: **nobody is watching them.**

## The Problem We Set Out to Solve

When we started building LumenFlow, we kept running into the same three failures:

**No receipts.** An agent pushes to production. Six months later, compliance asks "Who approved this?" You check git blame, Slack, PR comments — nothing. The agent didn't leave a trail because nobody asked it to.

**No guardrails.** You tell your agent "don't touch .env files." But that's a polite suggestion in a system prompt that nothing enforces. One hallucination later, your secrets are in a commit message.

**No boundaries.** You ask the agent to fix a login bug. It fixes the bug, refactors the payment module, updates three unrelated tests, and adds a dependency you've never heard of. Nothing stopped it because nothing *could*.

## What LumenFlow Does

LumenFlow sits between your agents and everything they touch — a **governance kernel** that enforces rules *before* actions happen, not after.

Every tool call goes through a 4-level scope intersection. Workspace, lane, task, and tool permissions must all agree before an action proceeds. One "no" at any level and it's blocked.

Every action produces an immutable, content-addressed evidence record. Not logs — cryptographic proof that can be independently verified.

Policies can't be loosened. The deny-wins cascade means a restrictive policy at any level stays restrictive. A lane can't override a workspace rule. Strictness only goes one direction.

## Open Source from Day One

We made LumenFlow open source under a dual-license model because governance software that isn't transparent about its own governance would be a contradiction.

- **AGPL v3** for the kernel and all packs
- **Apache 2.0** for the Control Plane SDK

Every source file carries an SPDX license header. Every package has the correct license in `package.json`.

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. We're building out the **Pack system** — pluggable extensions that add domain-specific tools, policies, and evidence types. The Software Delivery Pack ships built-in with 100+ CLI commands for structured software delivery.

We're using LumenFlow to build LumenFlow itself. Every feature, every bug fix, every refactor goes through the same governance kernel we're building for you.
