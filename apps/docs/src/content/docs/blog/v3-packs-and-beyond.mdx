LumenFlow v3 is the release where the architecture finally feels *right*. The kernel/pack separation we introduced in v2 is now fully realized, with clear documentation boundaries, a curated CLI surface, and a path for community-built packs.

## What Changed in v3

### Clean Documentation Architecture

v3.2 reorganized the entire documentation site around two pillars: **Kernel** and **Packs**. This isn't just a docs reshuffle — it reflects the actual architecture.

Kernel docs cover domain-agnostic concepts: the runtime, tool execution, scope intersection, policy engine, and evidence store. These apply regardless of what domain you're governing.

Pack docs cover domain-specific workflows. The Software Delivery Pack has its own section with concepts (WUs, lanes, gates), workflows (solo, team, idea-to-shipping), agent guides, setup instructions, and language-specific guides.

### Eight Language Guides

v3 expanded official language support to eight ecosystems:

- Node.js, Python, Go, .NET, Java, Rust, Ruby, PHP

Each guide covers gate configuration, test runner setup, and language-specific patterns. The guides aren't theoretical — they're tested against real projects.

### Curated CLI Surface

The CLI grew to 100+ commands over v1 and v2. In v3, we curated the surface: primary commands are documented and promoted, aliases exist for discoverability, and legacy commands are clearly marked. Run `pnpm lumenflow:commands` to see the full surface.

### Control Plane Integration

v3.5+ introduced the control plane — a remote coordination layer for fleet management and policy synchronization. The SDK (`@lumenflow/control-plane-sdk`) is Apache 2.0 licensed, so you can integrate it into proprietary systems.

v3.6 added post-command sync, so WU lifecycle events automatically propagate to the control plane after each command. No manual push required.

## The Road Ahead

### Community Packs

The pack system is designed for extensibility. We're finalizing the `create-a-pack` workflow and pack registry so teams can build and share domain-specific packs.

Imagine packs for:
- **Infrastructure governance** — Terraform plan review, drift detection
- **Data pipeline governance** — schema validation, lineage tracking
- **Customer support governance** — response quality gates, escalation policies

The kernel handles the governance mechanics. Packs bring the domain knowledge.

### Initiatives

Multi-phase projects that span multiple WUs and lanes. We use initiatives internally (INIT-045 defined 7 WUs for multi-pack config architecture), and we're polishing the workflow for general use.

### Better Metrics

DORA metrics, cycle time analysis, and flow visualization are already in `@lumenflow/metrics`. We're building dashboards in the web UI to make these accessible without the CLI.

## Try It Today

```bash
npx lumenflow init
```

Or if you're already using LumenFlow:

```bash
pnpm lumenflow:upgrade --latest
```
