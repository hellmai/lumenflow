# INIT-046 Plan - Sidekick Pack and Runtime Surface

Created: 2026-02-27

## Goal

Deliver Sidekick pack and runtime-surface capabilities in lumenflow-dev with a stable, validated 16-tool contract.
Complete INIT-046 across phases 1-3 with working storage abstraction, runtime dispatch surface, and publish-readiness verification.

## Scope

In scope for this plan:

1. Pack scaffold, manifest contract, schema wiring, and registration under packages/@lumenflow/packs/sidekick.
2. StoragePort abstraction with filesystem default adapter and concurrency-safe write behavior.
3. Five tool groups totaling 16 tools with descriptor + implementation coverage.
4. Consumer abstraction contract package and runtime dispatch endpoint coverage.
5. Validation, gates, and smoke-flow readiness for release quality.

Primary work units:

- WU-2231 through WU-2237 in INIT-046 execution order.
