title: Fix push-only micro-worktree stale base branch behavior
lane: 'Framework: Core Lifecycle'
type: bug
status: ready
priority: P1
created: 2026-02-14
code_paths:
  - packages/@lumenflow/core/src/micro-worktree.ts

  - packages/@lumenflow/core/src/__tests__/micro-worktree.test.ts
tests:
  manual:
    - From main with local main intentionally stale, run two consecutive push-only commands (e.g. initiative:edit twice); both should complete without requiring manual git pull --ff-only
  unit:
    - packages/@lumenflow/core/src/__tests__/micro-worktree.test.ts

description: 'Context: push-only micro-worktree operations currently skip pre-start origin sync and create temp branches from local main. Problem: when local main is stale (behind/ahead), commands like initiative:edit and other push-only flows can incur avoidable retry churn, race amplification, and incorrect base selection. Solution: in pushOnly mode with remote enabled, fetch origin/main and base temp branches on origin/main while preserving the contract that local main is not modified.'
acceptance:
  - withMicroWorktree pushOnly mode fetches origin/main before creating the temp branch when remote operations are enabled
  - pushOnly temp branches are created from origin/main (not local main)
  - pushOnly mode continues to avoid merging/updating local main
  - micro-worktree tests cover pushOnly pre-start fetch ordering and base-ref selection
  - existing push-only retry/rebase behavior remains intact
