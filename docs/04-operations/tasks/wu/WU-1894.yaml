description: Split from WU-1888. Migrate delegation/context commands (wu:brief, wu:delegate,
  wu:deps, wu:edit, wu:proto) from fallback/stub execution to native software-delivery pack handlers
  with resolver wiring and parity coverage.
acceptance:
  - wu:brief, wu:delegate, wu:deps, wu:edit, and wu:proto execute through software-delivery handlers
    in bootstrapped runtime mode
  - Resolver fallback stubs are removed for these delegation/context commands
  - Runtime execution for migrated commands succeeds without CLI fallback in strict migration mode
