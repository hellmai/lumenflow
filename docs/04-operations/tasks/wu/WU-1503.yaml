description: 'Context: wu:done merges lane branches and updates metadata but can proceed while main has unrelated dirty changes, leaving orphaned modifications behind. Problem: hidden dirty-main state can survive completion and pollute subsequent WUs. Solution: add explicit dirty-main pre-merge check in wu:done with actionable guidance and audited bypass flags.'
acceptance:
  - wu:done checks dirty state on main before merge operations
  - If dirty files are unrelated to current WU, wu:done blocks with actionable remediation
  - Bypass path is explicit and audited (e.g., --force or --stash-dirty)
