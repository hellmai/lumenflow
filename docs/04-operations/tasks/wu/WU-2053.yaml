  Post WU-2047: software-delivery is now runtime-native so there is no bundled/domain distinction.
  Just packs. Blocked by WU-2052 only (was blocked by deleted WU-2051 too).

description: 'Document pack architecture: what a pack is, how to author one (scaffold through
  publish), how packs distribute via registry/git/local. Update CLI reference for pack:* commands.
  No bundled/domain distinction — all packs use the same format and distribution.'
acceptance:
  - Pack concepts page documents what a pack is and how it works
  - Pack authoring guide covers scaffold through publish end-to-end
  - CLI reference updated for all 7 pack:* commands
  - Docs build passes
