description: 'Context: Consumer repos may have drifted package.json scripts and miss aliases like wu:status/wu:brief even when binaries are installed. Problem: Agents running pnpm wu:* hit command-not-found friction in older repos. Solution: Extend lumenflow-integrate --sync to also sync missing script aliases from the public command manifest without overwriting custom scripts.'
acceptance:
  - lumenflow-integrate --sync adds missing script aliases from public manifest to package.json
  - Existing custom script entries are preserved
  - Integration tests cover alias sync behavior including wu:status and wu:brief
  - No regressions in integrate command flow
