title: wu:create validate diverges from wu:claim manual-test requirement
lane: 'Framework: CLI Enforcement'
type: bug
status: in_progress
priority: P1
created: 2026-02-27
code_paths:
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/wu-create-validation.ts
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/wu-claim-validation.ts
  - packages/@lumenflow/core/src/wu-done-validation.ts
tests:
  manual:
    - Run wu:create --validate for a non-doc WU with empty tests.manual and verify behavior matches
      wu:claim policy
  unit:
    - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/__tests__/wu-claim-validation.test.ts

description: 'Context: wu:create --validate allows non-documentation WUs with tests.manual empty
  when other test buckets are populated. Problem: wu:claim then hard-fails the same WU because
  tests.manual is mandatory at claim time. Solution: align create-time validation and/or claim
  requirement so a WU that passes wu:create --validate is claimable without surprise.'
acceptance:
  - A non-doc WU with tests.manual empty fails consistently at create-time (or claim rule is
    relaxed) per single documented policy
  - Validation behavior is consistent across wu:create --validate and wu:claim
  - Regression tests cover the mismatched scenario (manual empty + unit tests present)
