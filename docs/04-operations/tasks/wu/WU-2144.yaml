description: wu:brief calls recordWuBriefEvidence() which writes a checkpoint event to
  .lumenflow/state/wu-events.jsonl regardless of context. When run from main checkout (e.g.
  orchestrator generating briefs), this mutates shared state before the WU is even claimed. The
  evidence recording should be gated on being inside a worktree, or deferred until wu:claim.
acceptance:
  - recordWuBriefEvidence skips writing when not in a worktree context
  - Running wu:brief from main checkout does not modify wu-events.jsonl
  - Running wu:brief from a worktree still records evidence as before
