  Context: Rules currently duplicated in .claude/, .cursor/, .windsurf/.
  Problem: DRY violation, rules drift between clients.
  Solution: Create .lumenflow/rules/ as single source of truth.
acceptance:
  - Create .lumenflow/rules/ directory structure
  - Move shared rules from .claude/ to .lumenflow/rules/
  - Document rule format in README
  - Update lumenflow:init to create rules directory
code_paths:
  - .lumenflow/rules/
  - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/commands/init.ts
tests:
  manual:
    - Verify rules directory created by init
  unit:
    - packages/@lumenflow/cli/src/__tests__/init.test.ts
