description: 'Split gates-config.ts (856 lines, 19 exports, 9 distinct responsibilities) into
  focused modules: gates-schemas.ts (Zod definitions), gates-presets.ts (preset expansion),
  gates-coverage.ts (coverage policy resolution), package-manager-resolver.ts (PM/TR resolution),
  and a slimmed gates-config.ts facade. Currently handles gate schemas, preset expansion, coverage
  config, package manager resolution, test runner resolution, build commands, gates commands, test
  policy construction, and ignore pattern generation all in one file.'
acceptance:
  - gates-config.ts reduced to under 300 lines (facade)
  - Each extracted module has single responsibility and under 300 lines
  - All existing gates tests pass without modification
  - pnpm gates end-to-end workflow unchanged
