description: 'WorkspaceSpecSchema requires software_delivery always. Make it optional. Add two-phase
  validation: phase 1 validates kernel root keys strictly, phase 2 resolves pinned pack manifests
  and allows only declared config_keys as extra root keys. Unknown root keys are rejected hard — no
  passthrough.'
acceptance:
  - WorkspaceSpecSchema no longer requires software_delivery
  - Workspace without software_delivery boots when SD pack not pinned
  - Workspace with unknown root key is rejected
  - Workspace with declared pack config_key is accepted
