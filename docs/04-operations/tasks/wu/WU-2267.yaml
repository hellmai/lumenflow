description: Add package.json to packages/@lumenflow/packs/sidekick so pnpm release includes it in the npm publish sweep. Consumers can then install via npm.
acceptance:
  - package.json exists at packages/@lumenflow/packs/sidekick/ with correct name, version, exports, and publishConfig
  - pnpm release --dry-run includes sidekick pack in publish list
  - pack:validate still passes after package.json addition
