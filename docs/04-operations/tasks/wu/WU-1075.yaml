description: Rename .beacon/ directory to .lumenflow/ throughout the codebase. This removes PatientPath-specific branding and completes the constant consolidation work started in WU-1068. Changes BEACON_PATHS to LUMENFLOW_PATHS with expanded entries for memory/agent/CLI packages.
acceptance:
  - BEACON_PATHS renamed to LUMENFLOW_PATHS in wu-constants.ts
  - Config schema defaults use .lumenflow instead of .beacon
  - .lumenflow.config.yaml stamps path updated
  - Memory/agent/CLI packages import from LUMENFLOW_PATHS
  - Migration script auto-renames existing .beacon/ to .lumenflow/
  - Gates pass
