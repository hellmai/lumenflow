description: 'readWU() and readWUAsync() in wu-yaml.ts share nearly identical YAML parsing and
  validation logic but are maintained as two separate code paths. Extract the shared parsing logic
  into a private parseWUYaml(content: string) helper. This reduces the DRY violation and makes the
  parse boundary a single point to add future validation.'
acceptance:
  - Private parseWUYaml helper extracted in wu-yaml.ts
  - Both readWU() and readWUAsync() delegate to the same helper
  - No logic duplication between sync and async variants
  - pnpm test --filter=@lumenflow/core passes
