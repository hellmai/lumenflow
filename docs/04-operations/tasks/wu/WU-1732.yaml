description: 'Context: INIT-029 Phase 3 — Policies + Packs. Depends on WU-1729 (ToolHost). Problem: The kernel needs a pluggable policy system (deny-wins cascade) and a pack loading mechanism with integrity verification. This is where the differentiator locks in — software delivery becomes just the first pack. Solution: PolicyEngine class with cascade evaluation (workspace -> lane -> pack -> task), deny-wins semantics, four trigger points (on_tool_request, on_claim, on_completion, on_evidence_added). DomainPack manifest schema (Zod) defining tools, policies, evidence_types, state_aliases, lane_templates. Pack loader that resolves from workspace config and verifies SHA-256 integrity hash. Approvals as typed events with run_id + scope + expiry. Plan: .claude/plans/golden-prancing-cookie.md'
acceptance:
  - 'PolicyEngine class with cascade evaluation: workspace -> lane -> pack -> task-specific'
  - 'Deny-wins semantics: deny at any level overrides allow from other levels'
  - Lower levels tighten only — loosening requires explicit opt-in
  - 'Four trigger points: on_tool_request, on_claim, on_completion, on_evidence_added'
  - 'DomainPack manifest Zod schema: id, version, task_types, tools, policies, evidence_types, state_aliases'
  - Pack loader resolves pack from workspace config and verifies SHA-256 integrity hash
  - Tampered pack (wrong hash) is rejected at load time
  - 'ApprovalEvent schema: typed events with run_id, scope, expires_at'
