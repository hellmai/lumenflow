description: Core spawn uses hardcoded TDD/Hex/90% Mandatory Standards. generateTestGuidance and tdd-directive don't consume resolvePolicy output. Methodology configurability from INIT-009/010 isn't flowing to agent prompts.
acceptance:
  - Spawn prompts use resolved methodology policy
  - Coverage thresholds come from policy not hardcoded
  - 'methodology.testing: none produces warn-only guidance'
