description: 'Context: strict debt in backlog/compliance flows sits in parser and collection modules that feed planning and governance outputs. Problem: these paths are cross-cutting and can leak weak typing into many downstream commands. Solution: remediate strict errors in compliance parsing, transaction collectors, and dependency graph modules with explicit data contracts and guardrails.'
acceptance:
  - Strict errors are removed from targeted backlog/compliance files
  - Compliance and dependency behavior remains stable under existing tests
  - No net increase in as any usage in touched core files
  - Backlog/compliance related core tests pass
  - Core strict progress baseline reflects reduced debt for this wave
