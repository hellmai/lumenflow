description: Add an additive production CLI tracer bullet command, task:claim, routed through
  KernelRuntime. This establishes a direct runtime CLI path while keeping legacy routes intact in
  this batch.
acceptance:
  - Additive CLI task:claim command is implemented without removing legacy routes in this batch
  - task:claim executes through KernelRuntime and emits expected lifecycle events
  - CLI public manifest exposes task:claim for runtime-backed command registration
  - Unit coverage validates task-claim command behavior and registration wiring
