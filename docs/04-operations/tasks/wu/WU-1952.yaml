description: Add pack:author CLI flow for template-based no-code pack creation and harden pack:validate with security lint rules for scope, permission, and network safety.
acceptance:
  - pack:author supports interactive and spec-file driven generation paths
  - Generated packs pass pack:validate for safe template configurations
  - pack:validate fails unsafe wildcard-write or invalid network scheme configurations with actionable errors
