description: The pre-commit.mjs hook unconditionally blocks all commits on main/master. The release script sets LUMENFLOW_WU_TOOL=release but pre-commit.mjs does not check this env var — only LUMENFLOW_FORCE. Add release bypass alongside the existing LUMENFLOW_FORCE check, same pattern as pre-push.mjs and validate-worktree-discipline.sh.
acceptance:
  - pre-commit.mjs allows commits when LUMENFLOW_WU_TOOL=release
  - Release script succeeds end-to-end with --skip-publish
