description: Worktree gate runs are currently failing due to pre-existing @lumenflow/cli test
  regressions (e.g. wu-edit.test expectations). Stabilize the failing tests so docs and maintenance
  WUs can complete without skip-gates.
acceptance:
  - pnpm gates passes for representative worktree WUs without needing --skip-gates for these
    pre-existing test failures
  - '@lumenflow/cli failing test set from wu:prep logs is resolved'
