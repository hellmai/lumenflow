description: "Context: WU-1423 renamed config schema but left ~19 files with beacon references. 'Beacon' was the ExampleApp AI name - not LumenFlow related. Problem: beacon-migration.ts exists as migration utility but migration is complete. Comments, regex patterns, and ExampleApp terms still reference beacon. Solution: Delete beacon-migration.ts and tests, remove all beacon references from comments/regex/constants. Zero beacon references should remain."
acceptance:
  - beacon-migration.ts deleted
  - beacon-migration.test.ts deleted
  - No TypeScript files contain 'beacon' (rg beacon --type ts returns empty)
  - Regex patterns like STAMP no longer support .beacon paths
